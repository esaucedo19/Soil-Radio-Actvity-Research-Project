# Soil-Radio-Actvity-Research-Project
The following data and code is from a Spring 2023 Undergrad Research Project at DePauw University. The purpose of the project was to measure the activity of a radioactive isotope of Potassium-40 present within the soil. The soil samples were taken from the DePauw Nature Park located in Greencastle, Indiana from two separate locations at the Nature Park. The two locations are designated as Q2 and W2 within the spreadsheets, and the data collected. There were 3 measurements taken for each location with a total of 6 measurements and graphs, Background, Raw Soil, and Soil Spiked with Pottasium Iodine, which would account for the natrual potassium in the sample. All graphs are fitted with a gaussian curve, and the spiked W2 sample as multiple fitted peaks.
